## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This application will allow users to compare presidential candidates based on each candidates proposals for comminly discussed issues. Users will also be able to group and view all candidates based on commonalities in policy proposals and political experience. I was inspired to create this application last year when I realized that a lot of political discourse is inaccessible to the average internet user. The rapid speed of the internet and the 24 hour news cycle can make it difficult and tiring to keep up with every moment of an election cycle. This app, however, will provide access to nonbiased information on mundane topics that Americans are concerned about so each person can make more informed political decisions.
